## makeCacheMatrix: This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
## Recall inverse of a matrix: let A be a matric, adj(A) its adjugate. The inverse of A is:
## A^-1 = 1/det(A)*adj(A)
## ES: A = |a b|; adj(A) = |d -b|; det(A) = ad - bc
##         |c d|           |-c a|

## For this exercise let's assume that the matrix supplied is always invertible
makeCacheMatrix <- function(){ 
  
}
