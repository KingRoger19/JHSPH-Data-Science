# JHSPH-Data-Science - Getting and Cleaning Data - W4 Submission

This _README_ is created to help users in reading actions performed by `run_analysis.R` used for the W4 submission's analysis.
<br/>
For data and relative descriptions you can refer to **CodeBook.md**

## Submission requirements

### Tasks
The R script called `run_analysis.R` does the following steps:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

### Outputs
1. A tidy data set.
2. A link to my Github repository with my script for performing the analysis. 
3. A CodeBook in the repo that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. 
4. A README.md in the repo.
5. Analysis R Script.
